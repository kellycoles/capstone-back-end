MowPro
Lawn Care Management

MowPro is a lawn care management application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete a list of customers, services provided, and jobs performed. It also affords users the ability to upload an image of the job site, see a dynamically generated map of the job site, and create PDF invoices and receipts for the customers, once the job is completed.

Additionally, users can keep records of all jobs and sort them by customers who owe and customers who have paid.  There is also a search feature that permits users to search all job records by customer name, address, email, phone number, service name, service description, and job notes.

MowPro was Built using .Net Core, Entity and Identity Framework, LINQ, JavaScript, jQuery, HTML, Bootstrap 4, CSS, and SQL server
